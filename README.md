## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The primary goals of this repository include:
- Understanding and implementing essential data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists.
- Mastering search and sort algorithms such as binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort, and quick sort.
- Learning how to perform basic operations with data structures in C++.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvnaik07/Lab_on_DS.git
   ```
2. **Compile and Run Programs:**
   - Use a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) to compile the `.cpp` files.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     g++ -o binary_search Binary\ Search.cpp
     ./binary_search
     ```
3. **Execute the Programs:**
   - You can also run the precompiled `.exe` files directly on Windows.

4. **Explore and Modify:**
   - Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different inputs to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
